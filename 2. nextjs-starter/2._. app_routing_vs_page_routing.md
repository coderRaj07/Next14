In Next.js 14, you have two main approaches to routing: the **App Router** and the **Page Router**. Each has its own features and benefits, and you can use them with or without the `src` folder structure. Here's a breakdown of each:

### App Router vs Page Router

#### **1. App Router**
- **Introduced in Next.js 13** and continues in Next.js 14.
- **File-based routing** with a more flexible and modern approach, integrating concepts like layouts, nested routes, and React Server Components.
- **Directory Structure:**
  - **`app/` directory** is used instead of `pages/`.
  - Routes are defined by folders and files within the `app/` directory.
  - Supports **Dynamic Routing** and **Nested Routes** with a simple folder structure.
- **Features:**
  - **Layouts and Templates**: Easily create shared layouts and templates.
  - **Server Components**: Use server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) seamlessly.
  - **Streaming**: Improved support for streaming content.
  - **Error Boundaries**: More granular control over error handling.
  - **Loading States**: Built-in support for loading states.
  
  **Example Structure:**
  ```
  app/
  ├── page.tsx
  ├── about/
  │   └── page.tsx
  ├── dashboard/
  │   ├── page.tsx
  │   └── settings/
  │       └── page.tsx
  └── layout.tsx
  ```

#### **2. Page Router**
- **Traditional approach**, still supported in Next.js 14 for compatibility and simplicity.
- **File-based routing** with the `pages/` directory.
- **Directory Structure:**
  - **`pages/` directory** contains your routes.
  - Supports **Dynamic Routing** but does not have the advanced features of the App Router.
- **Features:**
  - **Conventional Routing**: Direct mapping from the `pages/` directory to routes.
  - **API Routes**: Easily create API routes within the `pages/api/` directory.
  - **Static Generation (SSG) and Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Manually configure with `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths`.
  
  **Example Structure:**
  ```
  pages/
  ├── index.tsx
  ├── about.tsx
  ├── dashboard/
  │   ├── index.tsx
  │   └── settings.tsx
  └── _app.tsx
  ```

### App router Example (With or Without `src` Folder)

- **With `src` Folder**:
  - Organize your codebase with the `src/` folder to separate your application code from configuration and other files.
  - **Structure Example**:
    ```
    src/
    ├── app/
    │   ├── page.tsx
    │   ├── about/
    │   │   └── page.tsx
    │   └── dashboard/
    │       ├── page.tsx
    │       └── settings/
    │           └── page.tsx
    ├── components/
    ├── styles/
    └── utils/
    ```

- **Without `src` Folder**:
  - Place all your application files at the root level of your project.
  - **Structure Example**:
    ```
    app/
    ├── page.tsx
    ├── about/
    │   └── page.tsx
    └── dashboard/
        ├── page.tsx
        └── settings/
            └── page.tsx
    components/
    styles/
    utils/
    ```

### Summary

- Use the **App Router** for more modern features, including improved layout handling, server components, and nested routes.
- Use the **Page Router** if you prefer the traditional approach or need compatibility with older Next.js versions.
- The **`src` folder** is optional but can help with organization, especially in larger projects.

If you have specific requirements or preferences, that might influence which router and structure is best for your project.
