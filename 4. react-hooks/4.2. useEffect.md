## Quick Summary of useEffect

The `useEffect` Hook in React is essential for managing side effects in functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, it allows developers to perform operations such as data fetching, subscribing to events, or manually changing the DOM after a component renders.

### Key Features

1. **Syntax**: The `useEffect` Hook takes two arguments:
   - A function that contains the side effect logic.
   - An optional dependency array that determines when the effect should run.
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
       // Side effect logic
   }, [dependencies]);
   ```

2. **Execution**: By default, the effect runs after every render, including the initial render. If you provide an empty dependency array (`[]`), the effect runs only once when the component mounts.

3. **Cleanup**: If needed, the effect can return a cleanup function to perform any necessary cleanup before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. This is useful for unsubscribing from events or clearing timers.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using `useEffect` to update the document title based on a state variable:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function TitleUpdater() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
    }, [count]); // Effect runs when 'count' changes

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Conclusion

In summary, `useEffect` is a powerful tool for handling side effects in React functional components, enabling cleaner and more maintainable code compared to class-based lifecycle methods. Understanding how to effectively use `useEffect` is crucial for building dynamic React applications.
