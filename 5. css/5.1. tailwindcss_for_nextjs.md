## Quick Summary of Tailwind CSS Flexbox 

This guide covers essential Tailwind CSS flexbox utilities, including how to manipulate the layout of flex items using properties such as `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `order`, `self`, and `align-content`. We also cover practical examples of how to manage the main and cross axes using `align-items` and `justify-content`, along with practicing flexbox for JSX elements in **Next.js 14**.

## Understanding Main Axis and Cross Axis

- **Main Axis**: The direction in which the flex container's children are placed. 
  - It is **horizontal** when using `flex-row` or `flex-row-reverse` (default).
  - It is **vertical** when using `flex-col` or `flex-col-reverse`.

- **Cross Axis**: The direction perpendicular to the main axis.
  - When the main axis is **horizontal** (in a row), the cross axis is **vertical**.
  - When the main axis is **vertical** (in a column), the cross axis is **horizontal**.

---

## Flex Direction
`flex-direction` controls the main axis of the flex container and how the flex items are laid out.

- `flex-row`: Lays out items horizontally.
- `flex-row-reverse`: Lays out items horizontally in reverse order.
- `flex-col`: Lays out items vertically.
- `flex-col-reverse`: Lays out items vertically in reverse order.

---

## Justify Content
`justify-content` aligns flex items along the main axis (determined by `flex-direction`):

- `justify-start`: Aligns items to the start of the main axis.
- `justify-center`: Centers items along the main axis.
- `justify-end`: Aligns items to the end of the main axis.
- `justify-between`: Distributes items evenly with space between them.
- `justify-around`: Distributes items with space around them.
- `justify-evenly`: Distributes items with equal space between and around them.

---

## Align Items
`align-items` aligns flex items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis):

- `items-start`: Aligns items to the start of the cross axis.
- `items-center`: Centers items along the cross axis.
- `items-end`: Aligns items to the end of the cross axis.
- `items-baseline`: Aligns items along their baselines.
- `items-stretch`: Stretches items to fill the cross axis.

---

## Order
`order` allows you to change the order of flex items without modifying the HTML markup:

- `order-{number}`: Changes the position of an item. Higher numbers move the item further back in the layout.

---

## Self Alignment
`self` utilities let you override the alignment of a single flex item:

- `self-start`: Aligns the item to the start of the cross axis.
- `self-center`: Centers the item along the cross axis.
- `self-end`: Aligns the item to the end of the cross axis.
- `self-stretch`: Stretches the item to fill the cross axis.

---

## Flex Wrap
`flex-wrap` controls how flex items behave when there isn’t enough space:

- `flex-wrap`: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.
- `flex-wrap-reverse`: Wraps items onto multiple lines, but in reverse order.

---

## Align Content
`align-content` aligns rows of flex items when they wrap onto multiple lines:

- `content-start`: Packs rows to the start of the cross axis.
- `content-center`: Centers the rows along the cross axis.
- `content-end`: Packs rows to the end of the cross axis.
- `content-between`: Distributes rows with equal space between them.
- `content-around`: Distributes rows with equal space around them.
- `content-evenly`: Distributes rows with equal space between and around them, but accounts for the extra space between items.

---

## Example: Combination of Utilities
Here’s an example of using multiple flex utilities together:

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap-reverse justify-center content-center">
  <div class="flex-1 order-2">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-1 order-1">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-1 order-3">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

In this example:
- `flex-wrap-reverse` makes the items wrap in reverse order.
- `justify-center` centers the flex items horizontally.
- `content-center` centers the rows of items vertically.
- Individual items are reordered using the `order` class.

## Examples of Aligning with Main and Cross Axes

### Example 1: Using `align-items` (Main Axis = Vertical, Cross Axis = Horizontal)

In this example, the main axis is **vertical** (using `flex-col`), and the `align-items` property aligns flex items along the **horizontal** (cross axis).

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
  <div class="self-start bg-blue-200 p-4">Item 1 (aligned to start)</div>
  <div class="self-center bg-green-200 p-4">Item 2 (centered)</div>
  <div class="self-end bg-red-200 p-4">Item 3 (aligned to end)</div>
</div>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `flex-col`: Sets the main axis to vertical.
  - `items-center`: Centers all the flex items along the horizontal (cross axis).
  - `self-start`, `self-center`, `self-end`: Override the alignment for individual items along the cross axis (horizontal).

---

### Example 2: Using `justify-content` (Main Axis = Horizontal, Cross Axis = Vertical)

In this example, the main axis is **horizontal** (using `flex-row`), and the `justify-content` property aligns flex items along the **horizontal** (main axis). The cross axis is **vertical**.

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-stretch h-64">
  <div class="self-start bg-blue-200 p-4">Item 1 (aligned to top)</div>
  <div class="self-center bg-green-200 p-4">Item 2 (centered vertically)</div>
  <div class="self-end bg-red-200 p-4">Item 3 (aligned to bottom)</div>
</div>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `flex-row`: Sets the main axis to horizontal (default).
  - `justify-center`: Centers the flex items along the main axis (horizontal).
  - `items-stretch`: Stretches all flex items to fill the vertical (cross axis).
  - `self-start`, `self-center`, `self-end`: Override the alignment for individual items along the cross axis (vertical).
