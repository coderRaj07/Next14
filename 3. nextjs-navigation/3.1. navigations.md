There are some key points to keep in mind when handling navigation:

1. **Using `<a>` tags:**
   - When you use plain HTML `<a>` tags like `<a href="/home">Home</a>`, the browser makes a full-page reload and fetches the entire HTML document again. This behavior is not ideal in a client-side rendering setup where you want smoother navigation.

2. **Using `<Link>` from Next.js:**
   - Next.js provides a `<Link>` component that enables client-side navigation between pages, avoiding full page reloads. It wraps the `<a>` tag under the hood, which keeps the SPA (Single Page Application) experience intact.
   ```jsx
   import Link from 'next/link';

   <Link href="/home">
     <a>Home</a>
   </Link>
   ```
   This way, the navigation is done on the client side, leading to faster page transitions and a better user experience.

3. **Dynamic Navigation with `.map()`:**
   - If you want to create dynamic navigation links (like a menu or a list of pages), you can use `.map()` to loop through an array of route objects and generate links dynamically. For example:
   ```jsx
   const pages = [
     { name: 'Home', path: '/home' },
     { name: 'About', path: '/about' },
     { name: 'Contact', path: '/contact' }
   ];

   return (
     <nav>
       {pages.map((page) => (
         <Link key={page.name} href={page.path}>
           <a>{page.name}</a>
         </Link>
       ))}
     </nav>
   );
   ```

In this way, you avoid full-page reloads, improve user experience with client-side rendering, and easily generate dynamic navigation based on data.
